The source JSON files for the keymappings for my keyboards

## Keyboards

### Joker (DZ60)

Super basic 60% board. Only has 2 layers: Standard QWERTY layer, plus a single
FN layer.

### Riddler (Let's Split) [WIP]

A work in progress split 40% board. 4 layers: QWERTY, NAV, SYMBOL, NUMBER.

## Usage

Clone this repository, then upload the JSON files into QMK Configurator, make
any changes you want, then compile them and flash your board with QMK Toolkit.
