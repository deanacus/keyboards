# Riddler

A proposed 40% split ortholinear layout to go on a diy Let's Split PCB.

The layout.json does not match the layout.ascii file at this stage, as it's
still very much a work in progress, and I'm finding it easier to play around in
the ascii file rather than in QMK configurator or keyboard layout editor.

Specs:

| Component | Details                            |
|-----------|------------------------------------|
| PCB       | Let's Split                        |
| Switches  | TBD                                |
| Case      | TBD                                |
| Keycaps   | TBD                                |

## Usage

Upload the layout.json file into [QMK Configurator][conf], then hit compile and download
the firmware and flash it to your board.
