# Riddler

A proposed 40% split ortholinear layout to go on a diy Let's Split PCB.

The layout.json does not match the layout.ascii file at this stage, as it's
still very much a work in progress, and I'm finding it easier to play around in
the ascii file rather than in QMK configurator or keyboard layout editor.

## Usage

Upload the layout.json file into QMK Configurator, then hit compile and download
the firmware and flash it to your board.
